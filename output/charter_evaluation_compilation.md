The application would benefit from more robust evidence of innovation, clearly defined achievement strategies, and demonstrations of financial efficiency.
Including concrete success metrics and reducing generalities will strengthen the overall proposal and improve its credibility
- MarkCannon: Please provide some background on your organization … where is home base, where do you mostly draw your students from, how long in operation, what is your current enrollment?
What is the “why” … why replicate your commercial school?
- SusieMiller: Please Applicant does not provide any provide some background on your the proposed organization … where is home base, where do you they mostly draw your students from, how long in operation, what is your current enrollment? If they are going to use statements of experience from operating other virtual schools, this information should be provided.
- SusieMiller: 10-12, 39-41
The pages referenced do not offer support for the vision statement
Plan to contract with Flexpoint but no contract in place and not authorized by FLDOE. While it is a division of FVS, the Flexpoint product itself has not been approved as a virtual provider for use by charter schools.

## Section 2: Target Population and Student Body

### Strengths
- CametraEdwards: [p. 12-14]
The applicant provides a well-defined picture of the anticipated student body and names specifically: English Language Learners, students from military families, homeschooled students, gifted students, and those facing academic or social-emotional challenges.
The mention of diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds does align with the local Pinellas County demographics and the schools stated mission of inclusivity.
The projected enrollment table and rationale for growth seem manageable, with some caveats listed below.
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 12]
The Legacy Virtual School Application does provide a clear description of the intended student population and shows strong alignment with its overall mission.
“...mixed-gender and span ages 6 to 18... including students with varying educational needs, abilities, and backgrounds.”
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 10]
“...ensure that all learners—especially those from underrepresented communities, English Language Learners, and students seeking alternative pathways—have access to rigorous academic instruction...”
- DebraLister: Starting with 226 students allows Legacy Virtual School to maintain a focus on individualized instruction, ensuring that each student receives the attention and support they need. This manageable number enables the school to refine its operational systems, establish strong relationships with families, and ensure effective resource allocation.
In subsequent years, the growth plan anticipates a steady increase in enrollment, with projections reaching 972 students by Year 5. This progressive growth aligns with the rising demand for online education
- MarkCannon: 12-15
The applicant seeks to serve a diverse student population from across Florida, including students with varying educational needs, abilities, and backgrounds. It is designed to accommodate students who benefit from a flexible and individualized learning environment.
Based on state data from Florida charter schools, the applicant expects a significant proportion of Hispanic/Latino (46%), White (29%), and Black (18.4%) students.
Enrollment climbs from 226 to 972; year 1 grades 4-12.
Cites Pinellas @ 36.5% eco disadvantaged and projects free equipment ranging from 40 to 47% depending on the year.

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: [p. 12-16]
Most references are to national and state charter enrollment trends, not Florida-specific data or trend analysis for virtual charter demand, which differ from brick-and-mortar.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 12-13]
The enrollment fluctuations need more explanation. For example, grade 7 goes from 25 to 50 to 25 to 50. Why are some grades doubling and then halving? Explain the inconsistency.
The enrollment projects begin with upper elementary through high school in year 1; why start with 4th grade?
- CarlosCapellan: While general projections are given (e.g., 40–47% qualify for free equipment), there are no specific enrollment goals by subgroup (e.g., % ELLs or IEP students)
- DebraLister: [p. 12]
Why does 7th grade double then half years 2-4
- DebraLister: [p. 7]
-Legacy Virtual School will not give enrollment preference or limit the enrollment process to specific student populations
Legacy Virtual School is a proposed Florida-based virtual charter school designed to meet the evolving educational needs of K–12 students across the state.
Statewide charter?
- MarkCannon: 13
The applicant did not explain its reasoning for starting at grade 4 in year 1.
- MarkCannon: 13-14
While the applicant cited the growth of online learning, it did not provide a research basis for how its model would successfully compete among the growing ranks of other virtual providers to attain its strong enrollment growth.
- SusieMiller: 13-14
Review team has concerns that recruiting students in fourth grade could be problematic (i.e. either in not being able to recruit students or that the students who are recruited are likely to be students who have had issues in other school environments which could have an impact on the makeup of the student population.)
- SusieMiller: 13
While the applicant cited the growth of online learning, it did not provide a research basis for how its model would successfully compete among the growing ranks of other virtual providers to attain its strong enrollment growth.
- SusieMiller: 12-16
Initial enrollment numbers in upper grades and incremental growth in upper grades:
No explanation provided as to why  Explain thoughts behind lower grades increasing increase by 10 students in Year 2 but upper grades by 15
No explanation to the rationale of how if lower grades only have If you are starting lower grades at 25 or 30 students, how do you see the school will be able to obtain enrollment of getting 40 to 50 students in middle school grades initially?
Plan to serve virtual students throughout Florida, however, Florida Virtual is the only statewide authorized provider by statute. This particular application would be a Pinellas school. While statewide attendance would be possible through open enrollment rules, this would be a Pinellas county school.
- SusieMiller: 12-13
Application indicates that charter schools statewide have grown by 53,000 post pandemic and that Florida Virtual has grown.  In fact, Florida Virtual has reduced full-time enrollment.
Most references are to national and state charter enrollment trends, not Florida-specific data or trend analysis for virtual charter demand, which differ from brick-and-mortar.
The enrollment fluctuations need more explanation. For example, grade 7 goes from 25 to 50 to 25 to 50. Why are some grades doubling and then halving? Further explanation of the into the rationale for these decisions was not provided.Explain the inconsistency.

## Section 3: Educational Program Design

### Strengths

Virtual field trips, coding projects, and problem-solving scenarios challenge students to think critically and apply their knowledge in real-world contexts.
- DebraLister: [p. 25]
At our school, reading is a primary focus of the
curriculum, with a robust and research-based
approach that supports students across all reading levels. Our curriculum is aligned with Florida’s state
standards, including the Language Arts Florida
Standards (LAFS) and the B.E.S.T. Standards,
ensuring that every student is provided with the
necessary tools to succeed in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language skills.
For students reading at or above grade level, we offer advanced reading strategies such as literature circles, Socratic seminars, and project-based learning,
fostering critical thinking and complex literary analysis. Our program emphasizes the importance of academic rigor, promoting higher-order literacy skills essential for success in middle school, high school, and beyond.
For students reading below grade level, our curriculum integrates foundational phonics instruction, focusing on decoding and encoding as primary strategies for word reading. We use evidence-based structured literacy programs that build phonemic awareness, fluency, and comprehension. These strategies are aligned with the Comprehensive Research-Based Reading Plan
(CRRP), which is state-adopted and designed to meet the needs of struggling readers.
In line with the school’s commitment to differentiated instruction, we use strategies like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to cater to diverse learning styles.
- DebraLister: [p. 37]
This includes small-group instruction, individualized
interventions, and formative assessments that ensure all students are progressing at their own pace. For students with significant reading deficiencies, we implement
intensive reading interventions as early as possible, following the RtI/MTSS framework for targeted support.
Additionally, writing is integrated across all subjects, ensuring that students are not only reading critically but also expressing their understanding through written responses, journal entries, and essays. Grammar, usage, and mechanics (GUM) are taught explicitly to support students in mastering the conventions of standard
English, preparing them for future assessments and success in college and career.
Math
For students performing at or above grade level, the curriculum is designed to challenge them and expand their problem-solving and reasoning skills. These
students will engage with advanced topics such as
algebra, geometry, calculus, and data analysis, all within the framework of the MAFS.
For students performing below grade level, the curriculum focuses on building foundational math skills. The goal is to ensure mastery of basic operations and concepts, such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, before moving on to more complex material.

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: [p. 46], 50
Misalignment in assessment language (discussing the FSA instead of F.A.S.T. assessments)
- CametraEdwards: [p. 45]
Naming a five year proficiency goal of 80% with limited discussion of how this scale of improvement will be achieved other than naming remediation and acceleration
- CametraEdwards: [p. 47]
It appears that the applicant states that they will follow the Pinellas County student progression plan requirements.  The application doesn’t meet the standards of the Pinellas County SPG. There are a lack of details regarding MTSS and student interventions, grade 3 promotion, CAPE certification options, and middle school PE and health requirements.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 47]
The section for English Language Learners is missing details about student placement and progress monitoring. How will this occur? (no mention of WIDA testing)
- CametraEdwards: [p. 50], 51
The assessment schedule in Attachment C is only the state assessment schedule. Where is the schedule for all of the assessments mentioned in the application?
Are the assessment tools mentioned vendor-based? Which vendors? Are these tools reliable and predictive indicators of student performance on Florida state assessments?
- CametraEdwards: [p. 53]
MTSS- effective MTSS guidance should include decision rules regarding when interventions should be escalated (e.g., Pinellas SPG mentions students failing a class as a trigger) and monitoring of implementation fidelity. Neither of these are mentioned in the plan
- CametraEdwards: [p. 53]
Early Warning Systems- the goal of an EWS is to name or detect when things go wrong using thresholds (e.g. # of absences) which aren’t mentioned nor specific timing when students will be flagged.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 51]
The statement that Pinellas County will oversee the administration of PM3 with support from their team. What does that mean?
More details need to be added with how they will ensure that they will be compliant with state assessment protocols for all assessments.
There is no mention of student social emotional health in the application at all.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 57]
Will the sponsor be responsible for training the ESE staff? Will the applicant be aligned to the requirements of Pinellas County’s SP&P?
- CametraEdwards: [p. 59]
Deeply concerned that the application names that they will follow all of the guidance from Pinellas County for MTSS and Child Find. How will the applicant implement these policies and procedures without similar structures in place for staffing, support, etc.?
Student support team lists positions (MTSS Coordinator) that are not mentioned in the staffing plan.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 67]
LSS position is of concern because they have so many responsibilities with MTSS and students identified with disabilities. They need extensive training in interventions, which are not aligned with the qualifications listed.
- CarlosCapellan: How will virtual co-teaching will be coordinated between general education and ESE teachers?
How will speech therapy, OT, or counseling services will be scheduled, tracked, and documented?
How will general education teachers will be trained to ensure accommodations are implemented with fidelity?
- DebraLister: Incorrect tests mentioned
Adopted Pinellas Student Progression Plan- but app doesn’t mention anything about that structure
SEL not mentioned
- DebraLister: [p. 65]
How will this be done in a virtual environment? To accommodate diverse learning needs, the school will implement differentiated instruction that includes individualized lesson plans, instructional materials, and assignments tailored to the specific learning profiles of students with disabilities. This approach will involve the use of manipulatives, visual supports, graphic organizers, and interactive learning tools to engage students and foster deeper understanding.
Virtual environment???
To ensure equitable access to the general education
curriculum for students with disabilities, our school will provide a range of supplementary aids and services.
Environmental and physical accommodations will be implemented to create accessible learning environments for all students. Adaptive seating, sensory-friendly
workspaces, and visual schedules will be incorporated to support sensory regulation and promote focus and engagement. Additionally, classrooms will be arranged to facilitate ease of movement for students with mobility impairments, ensuring that all students can navigate the learning environment comfortably and safely.
Budget doesn’t apply to this
- MarkCannon: 54
While addressing student level or class level interventions, the applicant did not clearly address how it would approach making educational program adjustments of a more systemic nature.
- MarkCannon: 55
The applicant did not address the processes it would use to ensure FERPA compliance.
- MarkCannon: 59-62
Several MTSS strategies were not appropriate for virtual learning.
- SusieMiller: 55
The applicant did not address the processes it would use to ensure FERPA compliance.
The applicant does demonstrate a clear understanding not understand the requirements of FERPA requirements.  This is a major concern.
- SusieMiller: 46,50
The application is misaligned in assessment language (discussing the FSA instead of F.A.S.T. assessments)
- SusieMiller: 45,47
Some of the goals included are not clear and detailed making them difficult to measure.  For example, a five year proficiency goal of 80% with limited discussion of how this scale of improvement will be achieved other than naming broad strategies such as remediation or acceleration without citing staff that will provide the remediation, when it will occur, at what frequency, evidence of success of the proposed strategy with students that are similarly situated, etc.
The applicant states that they will follow the Pinellas County student progression plan requirements.  The application doesn’t meet the standards of the Pinellas County SPG. The application lacks details regarding MTSS and student interventions, grade 3 promotion, CAPE certification options, and middle school PE and health requirements.
- SusieMiller: 50,51
The section for English Language Learners is missing details about student placement and progress monitoring.  The application makes no mention of WIDA testing. How will this occur?
The assessment schedule in Attachment C is only the state assessment schedule. No additional information was provided for the numerous other assessments that were mentioned throughout the applicationWhere is the schedule for all of the assessments mentioned in the application?
- SusieMiller: 53
Numerous assessments are indicated throughout the application narrative without explanation. It is not explained what the assessments are, if they are vendor-based, or whether they are reliable and predictive indicators Are the assessment tools mentioned vendor-based? Which vendors? Are these tools reliable and predictive indicators of student performance on Florida’s standards state assessments? .
- SusieMiller: 51
Effective MTSS guidance should include decision rules regarding when interventions should be escalated (e.g., Pinellas SPG mentions students failing a class as a trigger) and monitoring of implementation fidelity. Neither of these are mentioned in the plan.
The goal of an Early Warning Systems ( EWS ) is to name or detect when things go wrong using thresholds (e.g. # of absences) which aren’t mentioned nor is specific timing provided as to when students will be identified.
The application states statement that “Pinellas County will oversee the administration of PM3 with support from their team.”  It is unclear what this means, and is not the way the state assessment system typically works, therefore we would have expected more explanation. In addition, if they are marketing their school to students statewide as is described in the application, there is no explanation of what the implications are for students who reside outside of Pinellas county. Therefore it is unable to determine if the school will What is the mean? More details are needed detailing how the school will ensure that it will be compliant with state assessment protocols for all assessments.
There is no mention of student social emotional health in the application at all.
- SusieMiller: 59-62
Several MTSS strategies identified in the application were not appropriate for virtual learning.
Reviewers raised significant concerns that the application names that they will follow all of the guidance from Pinellas County for MTSS and Child Find. However, there was no explanation of HOW the  will the applicant will implement these policies and procedures without similar structures in place for staffing, support, etc.?  This was not addressed with sufficient specificity.
In making the student population projection of 18% based on FDOE website data, the applicants did not account for variations in the virtual learning environments, that number is based on all public schools.
FLDOE website indicates 16% state-wide and 12% for virtual.  Assumption is incorrect.
- SusieMiller: 57
18% is approximately 54 students. The applicants indicate that the initial staffing is one ESE teacher and 1 gifted teacher. These ratios do  not align to standards.  The application is not clear as to how the staffing will work.
The application is unclear and woefully lacking as to how the proposed school will serve students with disabilities effectively. No budget for ancillary services (e.g. speech) is provided.  The applicants also fail to provide detail regarding the provision of OT and PT services.
- SusieMiller: 67
The applicant does not provide any information about how ESE staff will be trained or brought up to speed on the Pinellas county processes and requirements.  Also, the applicant did not explicitly state that it would abide by and following the Will the sponsor be responsible for training the ESE staff? Will the applicant be aligned to the requirements of Pinellas County’s SP&P, nor how staff would be trained on those policies. ?
Student support team lists positions (MTSS Coordinator) that are not mentioned in the staffing plan or budget.
LSS position is of concern because they have so many responsibilities with MTSS and students identified with disabilities. They need extensive training in interventions, which are not aligned with the qualifications listed.

## Section 7: English Language Learners

### Strengths
- CametraEdwards: Clearly references Title VI, EEOA 1974, and the LULAC v. State of Florida Consent Decree.
Aligns with Florida’s Home Language Survey (HLS) requirements and uses language screeners appropriately.
Commits fully to following district-level ELL procedures on identification, instruction, monitoring, and exiting.
Uses HLS at enrollment; identifies students via state-approved screeners like WIDA or ACCESS.
Offers a mainstream inclusion model with ESOL-endorsed teachers and sheltered instruction where needed.
Commits to accommodations, native language support “when feasible,” and integration with core subjects to ensure equity.
Commits to at least three full-time TESOL/TESL-certified ELL teachers, with professional development and endorsement support.
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 71-74]
Legacy Virtual School presents a legally compliant, thoughtful plan for serving English Language Learners. The proposal reflects awareness of legal obligations, offers appropriate instructional supports, and includes plans for tracking progress and staffing.
- DebraLister: [p. 75]
Identification Procedures: During enrollment, families
will complete a Home Language Survey (HLS) as
required by Florida law. Students indicating a primary
language other than English will be assessed using the
English Language Proficiency (ELP) screener to
determine eligibility for ELL services.
Access to Programming: ELL students are given
equitable access to all school programs and resources.
We ensure that our ELL courses are aligned with
general education standards to integrate language
learning with core academic subjects. This approach
ensures that ELL students can participate fully in all
aspects of the school curriculum, including advanced
and elective courses.
At our school, each English Language Learner (ELL)
will have an Individual ELL Student Plan, maintained
as part of their permanent academic record. These
plans will:
- DebraLister: [p. 76]
1. Track student language proficiency and academic
progress.
2. Facilitate communication with parents,
students, and teachers about progress and
support needs. 3. Outline methods for
evaluation and monitoring.
4. Ensure parental and teacher involvement.
5. Provide processes for exiting or reclassifying students within the program.
6. Include provisions for periodic updates and
post-program reviews.
● Regular Assessments: Student progress will be
evaluated quarterly using tools aligned with state
standards, including formative and summative
assessments, classroom performance data, and teacher feedback.
● ELL Committee Reviews: The ELL Committee will review students’ progress biannually to ensure they are meeting language acquisition goals and grade-level competencies. Adjustments to instructional plans will be made as needed.
- MarkCannon: 71-74
Applicant discussed services and supports and intends to employ a team of at least three ELL teachers.

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: The 3-person ELL staff suggests a moderate ELL population, but the application doesn't provide numbers or percentages of expected ELL enrollment. A realistic projection (e.g., “we anticipate 8–12% of students will need ELL services”) is needed to match staffing to need.
The mainstream and sheltered models are mentioned, but details are thin. Best practice requires specifying instructional methods such as SDAIE, explicitly teaching language development, co-planning time with ESOL teachers, and access to sheltered-content courses
While communication in multiple languages and workshops are promised, the plan lacks specifics on frequency or structure (e.g., monthly family nights, parent advisory committees, translated materials for testing and placement letters).
It’s unclear how screeners will be administered online within the 20-day window, or how sheltered instruction and WIDA-accessible assessments will be implemented virtually.
- CarlosCapellan: Will ELL instruction be differentiated by proficiency level?
How will push in be scheduled?
Are there examples of digital tools they are using to provide support?
- MarkCannon: 71-74
The applicant did not include an ELL enrollment projection.

A realistic projection (e.g., “we anticipate 8–12% of students will need ELL services”) is needed to match staffing to need. The reviewer could not identify the budget for the 3 ELL teachers.  If they are in basic instruction, ratios for basic instruction after pulling out ELL are very high.   In addition, the three positions are not found in the budget presented by the applicant.
Applicant sStates students will have full access to programming, but do not indicate how.

## Section 8: School Culture and Discipline

### Strengths
- CametraEdwards: [p. 76]
The school clearly states that they will adopt the school district’s code of conduct
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 74-76]
I appreciated that there was a virtual specific discipline approach. Explanation of digital citizenship training is an example to support this evidence.
- DebraLister: [p. 76]
The school will adopt the local district’s code of conduct policy for student discipline
- MarkCannon: 75-76
The applicant focuses on holistic growth through a curriculum that emphasizes collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
The applicant will use the district’s code of conduct for student discipline.
- SusieMiller: 75-76
The application states the school will focus on holistic growth through a curriculum that emphasizes collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
The applicant will use the district’s code of conduct for student discipline.

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: [p. 76]
The application speaks of the student handbook in Appendix D, however there isn’t a student handbook attached.
The application doesn’t detail the procedures that teachers will use if students are non-compliant with disciplinary policies.
The application doesn’t detail the administrative roles in discipline as well as due process timeline. There are no clear protocols for investigation, notification, suspension, etc. in this section.
The application doesn’t address students with special needs, specifically, how will manifestation determination hearings be conducted or managed?
The application doesn’t mention virtual school specific disciplinary issues such as camera use, online integrity, and virtual misconduct (e.g., cyberbullying, etc.).
- CarlosCapellan: Is there an existing code of conduct? Adopting the local schools code of conduct, is that conducive to a virtual setting?
Are there proactive measures for parental involvement?
Strengthening the application with measurable culture goals, a draft Code of Conduct, deeper restorative-practice protocols, and formal stakeholder-engagement loops would make the plan more robust
- DebraLister: Does the local district’s code of conduct apply to virtual schools? Student handbook? Not attached.
- MarkCannon: 46
The applicant promoted the notion of global citizenship in the student performance section; to not address this in the school culture section seems a missed opportunity.
- MarkCannon: 75-76
No specific due process was referenced.

## Section 9: Supplemental Programming

### Strengths
- CametraEdwards: [p. 77], 78
All activities listed are consistent with the school’s vision and mission and would serve as an extension of the academic programming. They can be adapted to a virtual format, including virtual fieldtrips, speakers, etc.
Funding sources are identified (e.g., budget, grants, fundraising).
- CametraEdwards: The Parent and Student Advisory Councils have clear roles (provide feedback, policy input, communication bridge), regular meeting schedules and a reporting pipeline to the Board through the Head of School.
Clearly outlined grievance policy that meets state statute.
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 77]
The school provides a list of virtual clubs (e.g., Reading Club, Physical Education Club, Coding Fundamentals, Life Management Skills) that align with its educational program and support student engagement and development
Clubs are designed to foster student interest, leadership, collaboration, and 21st-century skills—consistent with the school’s mission and instructional design
All activities are virtual and accessible across the state, supporting underserved and remote students without geographic barriers
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 79-80]
Legacy Virtual School’s governance plan is strong, legally compliant, and aligned with Florida statute. The governing board has the authority, structure, and expertise to oversee the school’s success. The application clearly separates governance from management and demonstrates a solid understanding of public accountability, transparency, and conflict management.
The application contains responsibilities include hiring and evaluating school leadership, approving the budget, ensuring compliance, reviewing academic performance, and setting strategic policy.
The application delineates governance (board oversight and policy) from management (executive director, principal, and school leadership). Board does not micromanage day-to-day operations.
- DebraLister: 1. Clubs and Organizations:

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: [p. 77-78]
There’s no mention of staffing for these activities. Who runs the clubs (teachers, volunteers, staff)? Will club leaders receive a stipend?
There is no information provided on exactly how the school will monitor or evaluate the effectiveness of this programming.
- CametraEdwards: Deeply concerned that the Board is composed of persons who do not reside in Florida and are employees of the online service provider who is also the Vice Chairperson of Board.
Additionally, who signed the governance disclosure forms on behalf of the Chairperson?
- CarlosCapellan: Are there success metrics for participation goals?
What is the staffing plan for this programming?
- CarlosCapellan: What are the details behind how members will be trained?
- DebraLister: 1002.33 bylaws pg 160
● None of the listed board members live in the state of FL, one doesn’t live in the US
● Each charter school’s governing board must appoint a representative to facilitate parental involvement, provide access to information, assist parents and others with questionsand concerns, and resolve disputes. The representative must reside in the school district in which the charter school is located and may be a governing board member, a charter school employee, or an individual contracted to represent the governing board. If the governing board oversees multiple charter schools in the same school district, the governing board must appoint a separate representative for each charter school in the district. The representative’s contact informationmust be provided annually in writing to parents and posted prominently on the charter school’s website. The sponsor maynot require governing board members to reside in the school district in which the charter school is located if the charter school complies with this subparagraph.
● No employee of the school shall serve as a Director. (Vasilii?)

- MarkCannon: 77-78
Does the applicant intend to charge fees for any of the supplemental programming?
- MarkCannon: 82-83
Will the applicant recruit board members in FL and when?
- MarkCannon: 79
The applicant indicated it has applied to the IRS; may we request to see its Form 1023?
- SusieMiller: 77-78
Applicant dDoes not explicitly clarify whether the school the applicant intends to charge fees for any of the supplemental programming.?
Reviewers were unable to locate Where in the budget is funding for traditional graduation venue and regalia in the budget, and this was mentioned in the application as an important event to host a since you indicated a traditional graduation?  In addition, the application is silent about Where is funding for staff travel to events such as these.?
There’s no mention of staffing for these activities. Applicant does not clarify Who who will runs the clubs (teachers, volunteers, staff) and whether thos individuals will ? Will club leaders receive a stipend? .
There is no information provided on exactly how the school will monitor or evaluate the effectiveness of this programming
- SusieMiller: 82-83
The application does not address if the applicant is looking to recruit board members in Florida and when that will occur.  Reviewers expressed deep concern that the proposed school's board is composed of individuals who,
a) do not reside in Florida, and
b) are employees of the online service provider, and
c) the leader of the online service provider is also the Vice Chairperson of the board.
- SusieMiller: 79
It was also impossible to determine whose signature was on the governance disclosure forms provided on behalf of the Chairperson.  Overall, the delineation between the Governing Board and the school management company is unclear and worrisome with regards to managing conflicts of interest as the inevitably arise.
The narrative explains the skill sets required in a governing board, however the current governing board does not have the skill sets the narrative identified as required.
The lack of local representation from Florida also raises concerns in terms of how the governing board is going to stay connected with the school community.
No indication of how the school plans to meet sunshine requirements with governing board members who are all out of state, and no indication that they understand the meeting requirements when meeting electronically. Also, no indication was provided in the narrative that the applicant understands the need to have a physical meeting location for those who are unable to attend virtually. In addition, in indication the applicant understands the need to have the principal and a individual who has been appointed to facilitate communication is required to be physically present at each meeting.
There is no evidence of understanding open meeting laws especially as it relates to TRIM requirements for budget.
Application indicates tax exempt status will be applied for. That should be in place.The applicant’s narrative is inconsistent about the current corporate status of the organization.  They indicate that they “will file for corporation,” and that “they are in the process of incorporating” and that the school “has applied for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status with the IRS.”  These three statements are inconsistent and cannot all be true simultaneously.

## Section 11: Management and Staffing

### Strengths
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 94-97]
There is a well defined management structure in the application
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 108-109]
The application has a clear professional development framework
- DebraLister: At the time of charter approval, Legacy Virtual School’s Governing Board, along with support personnel, will begin the process of identifying the school leader.
- MarkCannon: 94-100; 207-233
Adequate staffing and recruitment plan
- SusieMiller: 94-100; 207-233
The application outlines an adequate staffing and recruitment plan.

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: Appendix J
The organizational chart provided in Appendix J only outlines everyone reporting to the Principal/ Executive Director. Not sure how that demonstrates an evolving leadership structure over time.
- CametraEdwards: Pages 95-98
The staffing plan is not clear regarding support staff; therefore it is difficult to predict if the school will be within appropriate ratios for services for English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Clearly a lot of thought went into the staffing plan for leadership and administration, however the same depth is not apparent in creating the staffing structure for teachers and support staff.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 100]
It is difficult to determine what differentiated levels of support will be provided for new and struggling teachers. The application states that “support” will be provided and experienced teachers will provide assistance. What other mechanisms will be in place to support and train teachers who are new to teaching and/or teaching in the virtual environment?
I’m not sure that I understand the role of the media center specialist and why they would be hired during the pre-operational year.
There are terms used interchangeably throughout the application to describe the school’s leader. The job description in Attachments K-L says School Leader. Is this the job description for the Executive Director? Appendix M’s job description reads Assistant School Leader/ Principal.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 96-97]
Principal won’t be hired until Year 4 of operations. How will that shift the responsibilities of the Executive Director once the Principal is hired? The org chart in Attachment J lists the Principal as being managed by the Executive Director and having no management responsibilities.

The applicant needs to clarify as the organizational charts show all lines reporting to the Principal/Exec Dir.
- MarkCannon: 94-95, 178-184
This section was modified since the last application to be less clear about the CEO role (who does not have a degree or work experience in education); and briefly discusses a hiring process for a school leader to involve internal candidates, but elsewhere the applicant notes the CEO will be instrumental in overseeing management.
- MarkCannon: 121-22, Budget printout 15
With the involvement of the CEO and only 0.5 FTE of an Exec Dir (and later a Principal), this prompts questions of how will staffing, and overall financing, be separate and distinct from the commercial school?
- MarkCannon: 81, Budget printout 15
During planning and start up, what is the interplay between the CEO of the Board and the 0.5 Exec Dir (or are they one and the same)? There is reference to the Board evaluating the Principal/Head of School, who is not slated to be hired until year 4. In the interim, who is the Board holding accountable and, if also the CEO, how will this evaluation be objectively conducted
- SusieMiller: 207-209
The applicant needs to clarify as the organizational charts and show all lines reporting to the Principal/Exec Dir.
- SusieMiller: 81, Budget printout 15
During planning and start up, the staffing plan identifies a what is the interplay between the CEO of the Board, and the a 0.5 Exec Dir (or perhaps they are the same position and the applicant is using the terms interchangeably, but this raises concerns about the validity and clarity of the plan).  There is no explanation of how these roles
interact and which is responsible for which aspects of the school’s start up process. are they one and the same)?
There is reference to the Board evaluating the Principal/Head of School, who is not slated to be hired until year 4. In the interim, who is the Board holding accountable and, if also the CEO, however, no information was provided in the application regarding how this individuals how will this evaluation will be objectively conducted?.
No discussion in the application about recruiting administrative staff or what type of PD they will be offered.  In addition, no information provided about how the school would What is the process for on-boarding the administrative team.?  These activities were also nNot funded in the budget.
Application indicates that the Chair of the Board will manage day to day operations which comingles governance with operations and is a problem structurally.
An organizational chart should indivate has reporting lines so that not .  Not all staff report to a single person without levels and hierarchy.
- SusieMiller: Appendix J
The application indicates all the following staff will be hired in Year 1 and none of them are budgeted:
Director of Finance
Director of Admission
Director of Human Resources
Business Manager
Principal’s salary is below market salaries for the position which will make recruiting difficult.
- SusieMiller: 95-98
The organizational chart provided in Appendix J only outlines everyone reporting to the Principal/ Executive Director. This does not appear to demonstrate Not sure how that demonstrates an evolving leadership structure over time. There are terms used interchangeably throughout the application to describe the school’s leader. The job description in Attachments K-L says School Leader, however it is unclear if the provided information was applicable to the Executive Director or another role within the leadership, and then . Is this the job description for the Executive Director? Appendix M’s job description reads Assistant School Leader/ Principal.
- SusieMiller: 100
The staffing plan is not clear regarding support staff; therefore it is difficult to predict if the school will be within appropriate ratios for services for English Language Learners and students with disabilities.
- SusieMiller: 96
Clearly a lot of thought went into the staffing plan for leadership and administration, however the same depth is not apparent in creating the staffing structure for teachers and support staff.
It is difficult to determine what differentiated levels of support will be provided for new and struggling teachers. The application states that “support” will be provided and experienced teachers will provide assistance. The narrative does not explain What other mechanisms that would will be in place to support and train teachers who are new to teaching and/or teaching in the virtual environment?.
- SusieMiller: 97
The applicant has added a I’m not sure that I understand the role of the media center specialist to the role, but the review team was unclearn how this role would be applicable to a virtual environment, and why this person would need to be hired and why they would be hired during the pre-operational year.
Principal won’t be hired until Year 4 of operations.

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: [p. 101-102]
The HR narrative seems to treat staff as if they are employed by a brick and mortar school. There will be unique support needed for a virtual environment, (e.g., remote engagement, tech fluency) that are not mentioned in the application.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 104]

### Strengths
- CametraEdwards: Clear pre-opening induction plan that includes LMS training, ELL support and behavior expectations.
Specific commitment to 10 PD days throughout the school year.
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 108-109]
PD is differentiated for roles: instructional staff receive pedagogy and assessment training, while administrators receive leadership development and compliance training.
Teachers use PD sessions to analyze performance data and adjust instructional practices; aligns with goals to close achievement gaps and improve outcomes.
- DebraLister: [p. 109]
PD will combine individualized sessions addressing specific needs with uniform training aligned to school-wide goals. Both in-house workshopsand external training by state and national experts will be utilized.
Evaluation of Effectiveness
Effectiveness will be assessed using metrics such as student performance data, classroom observations, staff feedback, and school climate surveys. The Professional Development Team (PDT) will analyze these indicators and make adjustments as needed.
Legacy Virtual School allocates a minimum of 10 PD days annually (60–80 hours). This includes pre-scheduled PD days, after-school workshops, and early-release days, allowing for skill development, curriculum alignment, and collaboration. The Leadership Team will provide faculty with exact PD dates, aligned to the District calendar. Weekly PLCs and common planning periods are embedded into the schedule to ensure ongoing collaboration. The staffing structure ensures uninterrupted instruction while teachers engage in training.
- MarkCannon: 108-109

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: [p. 108]
The Director of Curriculum and Professional Development is responsible for PD. This title is not mentioned in the 5 year staffing plan.
- CametraEdwards: [p. 109]
No mention of PD that is specific for virtual schools like: synchronous/ asynchronous engagement strategies, differentiation and support in the virtual environment, monitoring student engagement remotely.
No mention of PD activities for leadership or support staff.
- MarkCannon: 108, Budget printout 15
The Director of Curriculum and Professional Development (or any position resembling this) appears to not be a funded position.

The Director of Curriculum and Professional Development (or any position resembling this) appears to not be a funded position. This title is not mentioned in the 5 year staffing plan.
- SusieMiller: 94
Please define “numerous hours.”
The application includes 10 days of training prior to the start of the school year. There is insufficient detail regarding teacher compensation for these 10 days. or teachers up front.  Reviewers thought this 10 day training period may use most of Professional Development budget for the entire year.

## Section 14: Student Recruitment and Enrollment

### Strengths
- CametraEdwards: [p. 110]
The application has a comprehensive recruitment strategy targeting different groups (e.g., low income, ELL families)
- CarlosCapellan: Legacy Virtual School’s recruitment and enrollment plan meets the standard by providing a lawful, inclusive, and mission-aligned approach to attracting a diverse student population across Florida.
Recruitment strategies include: digital ads, social media, partnerships with community organizations, homeschool networks, military bases, and virtual open houses.
The plan is backed by market research and statewide charter school growth trends, with year-by-year projections from 226 (Year 1) to 972 (Year 5).
- DebraLister: We will implement targeted outreach efforts tailored to different racial
and ethnic groups through:
● Social media campaigns
● Partnerships with local community organizations
● Culturally relevant advertising
● Informational sessions in multiple languages
● Providing accessible enrollment resources to ensure all families can
learn about our school
A diverse team of educators and administrators will reflect the
community’s composition, creating an inclusive learning environment.
This will enhance student engagement and foster strong connections
with families from various backgrounds.
- MarkCannon: 110-112; 234-237
The applicant discussed its marketing approach in broad terms and outlined a lottery process.
- SusieMiller: 110
The application has a comprehensive recruitment strategy targeting different groups (e.g., low income, ELL families)

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: The application doesn’t have enrollment projections by grade level or quantified goals.
- CarlosCapellan: Is the lead person for these efforts identified in the application?
Are there specific goals tied to this section?
- DebraLister: Are there any community partnerships set up? Board is out of state.
- MarkCannon: 111
What are some examples of targeted marketing the applicant expects to use to reach underrepresented demographics?
- MarkCannon: 112
The applicant will conduct at least two rounds of enrollment in Jan and Feb involving a lottery each time if applications exceed capacity.
- MarkCannon: 112
A couple of the enrollment preferences do not align with Federal guidance (if planning to apply for a CSP subgrant).
- SusieMiller: 111
The applicants’ do not provide examples of targeted marketing the applicant expects to use to reach underrepresented demographics.
112
Some of the enrollment preferences do not align with Federal guidance. If the school is planning to apply for a CSP subgrant, this will be a problem.
The student application is very long and will make it difficult for some families to apply.
No method to apply without access to technology is available, which leads the reviewer to equity concerns.
The application doesn’t have enrollment projections by grade level or quantified goals.
The applicant includes a statement that the school would “offer scholarships or financial aid options to ensure access regardless of financial constraints” which raises concerns about the applicants understand that this would be a public school, and that they are not
allowed to charge tuition or any fees that would not be typical at other public traditional schools.

## Section 15: Parent and Community Involvement

### Strengths
- CametraEdwards: [p. 115]
Mentions the state required PIR
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 114]
Legacy Virtual School outlines diverse touchpoints, including virtual town halls, parent-teacher conferences, learning management system access, and real-time communication tools.
The school plans to collaborate with homeschool associations, military bases, nonprofits, and ESE/ELL advocacy groups to ensure wraparound support and broad reach.
- DebraLister: Family-School Partnerships: We will build robust partnerships through
regular virtual meetings, workshops, and family events designed to
engage parents in their child's education and school activities. These
initiatives will include academic workshops, technology tutorials, and
parent support groups.
Volunteer Opportunities
Monthly Newsletters
Weekly Updates
Parent-Teacher Conferences
Assigned Parental Involvement Representative:
- MarkCannon: 113-115
The section was largely devoted to the Parental Involvement Representative (PIR)
- SusieMiller: 113-115
The section was largely devoted to the Parental Involvement Representative (PIR) and mentions the state required PIR.

### Concerns
- CarlosCapellan: Is parent voice part of the planning? (Parent Teacher Association format)
- MarkCannon: 90
How will the PIR interact with the Parent Advisory Council (PAC)?
What are some examples in which parent or community input has led to a modification in the applicant’s approach or program at its commercial school?
- SusieMiller: 90
The applicant explains in the narrative that it will have a Parent Advisory Council (PAC), but does not provide any information about how the PIR How will the PIR will interact with the Parent Advisory Council (PAC)?.
Given that the applicant is running other schools, it would have been helpful to included What are some examples in which parent or community input has led to a modification in the applicant’s approach or program at its commercial other schools, but this was not provided.?

## Section 20: Budget

### Strengths
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 116-118]
Revenue and expenditures are consistent with the school’s phased growth model and instructional strategy, including costs for curriculum, staffing, student support, and virtual learning infrastructure.
Projections are based on Florida per-pupil funding formulas, adjusted for virtual charter school allocations. Revenue estimates align with projected enrollment (226 in Year 1 to 972 in Year 5).
Major budget items include personnel salaries/benefits, curriculum providers, tech services, software licenses, professional development, and laptops for students.
- DebraLister: Legacy School Inc., a U.S.-based company, plans to provide financial assistance to Legacy Virtual School
through a loan of $400,000 at an annual interest rate of 8% over a six-year term, contingent upon the
approval of the application. Interest payments will begin in the year following the loan disbursement, with
the principal to be repaid in equal installments during the 3rd, 4th, and 5th years of the school’s
operation.
In addition, Legacy School Inc. is prepared to offer an additional $160,000 credit line at an annual interest
rate of 8%, with a five-year term starting from the first year post-approval. The principal for this credit
line will also be repaid in equal installments over the 3rd, 4th, and 5th years of the school’s operation.
Revenue Assumptions:
Foundation Funding; The budget relies on calculations from the Foundation for Excellence in Education
(FEFP) as a revenue source. Key elements include Base FEFP Funding,
ESE Guaranteed Allocation and
specific allocations like Supplemental Academic Instruction, Safe Schools and Discretionary Local Effort.
The projections indicate an increase in FEFP revenue as enrollment grows annually.
Percentage Reserve: Allocating 3% of the total budget annually to reserves ensures that the contingency fund
keeps pace with the school's expansion and operational costs. This strategy allows for financial flexibility and
preparedness in case of revenue fluctuations.
At 75% of Revenue Projections
The school would implement cost-cutting measures across non-essential services and delay any expansion
plans to prioritize core operations.
The reserve fund would cover immediate shortfalls, allowing time to adjust operational costs and seek
additional funding sources.
At 50% of Revenue Projections
The school would rely heavily on its reserve fund to maintain essential operations.
Significant adjustments would be necessary, including reductions in discretionary spending, contract
renegotiations, and potential staffing adjustments.
The school could leverage an additional credit line from Legacy School Inc., which has already committed
$400,000 to support the preparatory year and $160,000 to the 1st year.
If necessary, the school would explore alternative funding sources to bridge the financial gap.
- MarkCannon: 121-129; 251-260, Budget Printout

### Concerns
- CametraEdwards: [p. 118]
The applicant mentions relying on a line of credit from Legacy School Inc. of $560,000. The loan will be paid back in two payments in years 4 & 5. What happens if the school doesn’t meet enrollment targets?
- CametraEdwards: [p. 116], Attachment T
The terms outlined in the financial letter of intent do not match the 5 year budget. The letter states that the principal will be repaid in equal installments in years 3, 4 & 5 while the budget only accounts for repayment in years 4 & 5.
- CarlosCapellan: Some costs (e.g., administrative overhead, shared services from virtual platform provider) could be broken down more clearly for transparency
- DebraLister: Year one budget: $400 for marketing and recruiting?
Enrollment: 199/226
Recruiting in grade 4? Why?
Get paid on students by completion- this budget assumes all completion (not accurate)
Reserve of 3% -
Start school with $400K grant+ $160K loan
Is there a conflict of interest here? Board chair loaning from other company
Facilities: no budget?
Hire finance /contract services: $15K (audit, day to day, monthly)
- MarkCannon: Budget printout 15
Year 1 budget is confusing as the narrative discusses hiring several administration staff that are not budgeted.
- MarkCannon: Budget printout 1
The percentage of full enrollment assumption is unrealistic, given course completion rates trend lower for virtual schools.
- MarkCannon: Budget printout 32, 36
The applicant proposes an inadequate budget for Accounting Fees and Internet.
- SusieMiller: Budget Printout 1
The percentage of full enrollment assumption is unrealistic, given course completion rates trend lower for virtual schools.
- SusieMiller: Budget printout 32,36
The applicant proposes an inadequate budget for Accounting Fees and Internet.
Year 1 budget is $400,000 and indicates it is all for recruiting, not presented as such in the spreadsheets.
Virtual schools are funded based on course completion.  Budget assumes 100% funding of all students.  Virtual % percent completion is around 85%, when this is properly applied to the budget, funding is in a deficit.
Application indicates funding for teachers is $445K and they intend to hire 13 teachers.  Their pay would be $34,000.  State minimum for teachers is $47,500 before benefits.
In looking at the budget template that was used, the number of teachers is significantly less than the narrative indicates as well.  [p. 96] of the application indicates 13 teachers including IEP, ELL, SLP and electives) during year one.  However, the budget includes only During year one, they would need 13 teachers to meet the description in the narrative, but only 9.8 FTE teachers.
Applicant indicates understanding of the state FEFP funding formula yet they define the acronym as Foundation for Excellence in Education.  FEFP has been defined in Florida statute since 1973 as Florida Education Finance Program.
Budget relies on staff taking voluntary leave if enrollment does not materialize.  Reality is they would be released and eligible for unemployment benefits which are not adequately budgeted.
Budget documents indicate that at 50% enrollment, they would need an additional loan which they do not have a commitment for.
Narrative indicates they will have a facility, it is not budgeted.
Narrative indicates they will use multiple platforms to educate students, the total funding is approx.. $1,250 per student including laptop which is inadequate.
- SusieMiller: 118
Narrative indicates that they will use an external firm for payroll, day to day financial operations. Monthly financial statements and annual audit.  Budget of $15,000 is significantly underfunded for these tasks.
- SusieMiller: 116, Attachment T
The applicant mentions relying on a line of credit from Legacy School Inc. of $560,000. The loan will be paid back in two payments in years 4 & 5. What happens if the school doesn’t meet enrollment targets?
The terms outlined in the financial letter of intent do not match the 5 year budget. The letter states that the principal will be repaid in equal installments in years 3, 4 & 5 while the budget only accounts for repayment in years 4 & 5.
The applicant assumes successful completion of advanced placement, dual enrollment additional FTE, the amount they are anticipating in revenue from these programs is more than the than the net revenue presented in the budget each year, so without those funds their budget will be in the negative, and that is not a guaranteed source of income, so it can not be guaranteed. If just these funds were not realized, the budget would not work.
Based on the descriptions used throughout the narrative, the number of staff members presented in the budget does not align with the narrative.  For example, based on 1 ESE teacher for every 15-20 students as indicated in section 6, the school would need to hire 0.5 – 0.7 FTE for the first year of operation, but their budget document only included 0.4 FTE. This is true each year of operation, by year five the discrepancy is that the calculations indicate 3.4 – 4.5 teachers are needed, but they only budgeted for 2.8.   These types fof comparisons were also true for the counselor, for which a 0.8FTE would be required based on 1 cousnelor for every 250 students as indicated in the narrative, but they have only budgeted a 0.2 FTE counselor.  Learning Support Specialists are even more pronounced.  Where they have indicated they would have on parapro foe every 30-40 students, this would require about 5-6.6 FTE during year one, but the only have one position in the budget.
Section 7 says they will hire at least 3 ELL teachers. In the budget the only have 0.4 during year one, and 2.8 year 3 so they never have a full 3 staff members like they say they will in the narrative.
Narrative indicates that 90 students will qualify for free equipment year 1, they have put exactly 90 computers in the budget.  Later in the narrative they talk about having a reserve of computers for when machines break, this is not accounted for in the budget.
No staff computers are included.
No IT service provider, while they do have one person on staff, given the virtual nature and supporting so many machines remotely, this seems unrealistic.
No contracted ESE services, how will they meet the needs of students who may require additional services (i.e. OT, PT)
Year 3 is operating at a loss.
Years 1, 2 and 4 are very close. Any small deviation in assumptions could make the budget negative.

## Section 21: Financial Management and Oversight

### Strengths

- DebraLister: [p. 117]
Recruitment: For the year of planning $400,000 is set aside for marketing and recruitment efforts to attract a student base. This investment plays a role in establishing the school’s reputation and meeting enrollment targets from the outset.
- DebraLister: [p. 127]

Lack of understanding for FL minimum requirements
- MarkCannon: 122
The applicant lacked specifics on how it would carry out strong internal controls.
- SusieMiller: 122
The applicant lacked specifics on how it would carry out strong internal controls. It is lacking substance and a clear understanding by the applicant of requirements as basic as segregation of duties and financial reporting.
The narrative fails to explain the process by which the budget would be Will budget be presented to governing body at a noticed public hearing?  There is no discussion about this.
No indication that student records will be retained and stored in a fire proof safe.
There is no budget for ERP system to manage financial records.
ERP/ Payroll processing not mentioned

## Section 22: Start-Up Plan

### Strengths
- CarlosCapellan: [p. 124]
The application includes a detailed 12-month start-up timeline broken into pre-operational phases (e.g., board development, staff hiring, curriculum procurement, IT setup, student recruitment).
Each activity in the start-up plan is tied to a lead party (e.g., Executive Director, IT Director, Governing Board) and has projected timelines for completion.
- CarlosCapellan: The application presents a compelling vision, aligns the adaptation to student needs, and outlines the capacity and experience necessary for successful replication.
- CarlosCapellan: Many schools listed serve underserved populations, virtual learners, or students requiring flexible instructional settings—demonstrating alignment with Legacy’s mission.
The applicant's portfolio includes prior successful start-ups, showing the group’s ability to launch and sustain multiple campuses. This supports the current proposal’s viability.
- DebraLister: [p. 131]

Contract Finalization and School Infrastructure Setup
- MarkCannon: 261-265
The applicant operates a commercial school, Legacy Online School

### Concerns
- CarlosCapellan: Is the human capital there?
- CarlosCapellan: How will the ESP support multiple virtual needs?
- CarlosCapellan: How was the list of underserved population schools created?
- DebraLister: [p. 155]
Assessment schedule is set for 25-26, but school will not open until 26
- DebraLister: Application mentions schools in operation, but there are no details.
- MarkCannon: 130-132
The start-up plan outlines a series of activities in the planning period, but is slim on demonstrating how the various facets will lead to full school readiness.
- MarkCannon: 103-109
The application did not provide any quantifiable information to justify its existing model should be replicated. The only data point was it currently serves 12 percent SWD; percentages for other groups or proficiency data was not provided.
