Virtual Charter Application 
Review Team Feedback Notes







The Florida Charter Institute (FCI) utilizes this form to solicit feedback from the Review Team for a charter application. At the conclusion of our work to review the charter application we will ask that you submit this form to the FCI to document your notes and feedback on the application. 



It is important to remember that the FCI uses the review team to decide whether or not to recommend a charter application for approval. No individual member of the review team decides. The work we do is often subject to public record laws. It is possible that we may receive a public record request and need to provide copies of the work product used to lead to our final recommendation. Therefore remember that any notes you write on this form should be professional and able to be shared with the public.



Florida Charter School Application Evaluation Instrument



Each section presents criteria for a response that meets the standard, and these criteria should guide your consideration of each section. This form is developed so that you can mark each comment with one of the following: Question, Strength, Concern, or Follow Up. The table also allows you to indicate where in the section you are referring to, along with comments to explain your rationale. 



Capacity Interview: 



All applicants whose application meets the basic requirements during an initial interview will be invited to present their plan and demonstrate the team’s capacity to open and maintain a high-quality charter school and answer questions about their proposal. Before the interview, the review team will meet to discuss their independent review and compile a list of potential questions the team had while reviewing the application. Not all review team members will always participate in the interview. 



Following the capacity interview, those participating will be asked to update their notes and submit this form to the FCI.

Executive Summary



While the executive summary is not a scored section of the application, we encourage applicants to use the opportunity to develop their “elevator pitch”. The FCI hopes that the Executive Summary will paint a clear picture of the need the proposed school will fill, and how the unique program that the school will offer will meet that need. 





Part I – Educational Plan



The education plan should define what students will achieve, how they will achieve it, and how the school will evaluate performance. It should provide a clear picture of what a student who attends the school will experience in terms of educational climate, structure, assessment, and outcomes.





1. Mission, Guiding Principles and Purpose

The Mission, Guiding Principles and Purpose section should indicate what the school intends to do, for whom and to what degree. [Statutory Reference §1002.33(2)] 



A response that meets the standard will present: 



A clear and compelling mission and vision statement that defines the guiding principles and values of the school.

Adequate references to evidence that the application fulfills the statutory guiding principles and purposes for charter schools. (Note: the substance of each addressed principle and purpose will be evaluated within appropriate application sections.)

The applicant seeks to serve a diverse student population from across Florida, including students with varying educational needs, abilities, and backgrounds. It is designed to accommodate students who benefit from a flexible and individualized learning environment.



Based on state data from Florida charter schools, the applicant expects a significant proportion of Hispanic/Latino (46%), White (29%), and Black (18.4%) students.



The applicant provides a well-defined picture of the anticipated student body and names specifically: English Language Learners, students from military families, homeschooled students, gifted students, and those facing academic or social-emotional challenges.



The projected enrollment table and rationale for growth seem manageable, with some caveats listed below. 



Concern

The applicant did not explain its reasoning for starting at grade 4 in year 1.

Concern

13-14

Review team has concerns that recruiting students in fourth grade could be problematic (i.e. either in not being able to recruit students or that the students who are recruited are likely to be students who have had issues in other school environments which could have an impact on the makeup of the student population.)



Concern

13

While the applicant cited the growth of online learning, it did not provide a research basis for how its model would successfully compete among the growing ranks of other virtual providers to attain its strong enrollment growth.



Concern

12-16

Initial enrollment numbers in upper grades and incremental growth in upper grades:

No explanation provided as to why  Explain thoughts behind lower grades increasing increase by 10 students in Year 2 but upper grades by 15

No explanation to the rationale of how if lower grades only have If you are starting lower grades at 25 or 30 students, how do you see the school will be able to obtain enrollment of getting 40 to 50 students in middle school grades initially?

Plan to serve virtual students throughout Florida, however, Florida Virtual is the only statewide authorized provider by statute. This particular application would be a Pinellas school. While statewide attendance would be possible through open enrollment rules, this would be a Pinellas county school.



Concern

12-13

Application indicates that charter schools statewide have grown by 53,000 post pandemic and that Florida Virtual has grown.  In fact, Florida Virtual has reduced full-time enrollment.



Most references are to national and state charter enrollment trends, not Florida-specific data or trend analysis for virtual charter demand, which differ from brick-and-mortar.



The enrollment fluctuations need more explanation. For example, grade 7 goes from 25 to 50 to 25 to 50. Why are some grades doubling and then halving? Further explanation of the into the rationale for these decisions was not provided.Explain the inconsistency.





3. Educational Program Design

The Educational Program Design section should describe the educational foundation of the school and the teaching and learning strategies that will be employed. [Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(7)(a)2.]



A response that meets the standard will present an educational program design that:



An educational program design that:

Is clear and coherent; 

Is based on effective, experience or research-based educational practices and teaching methods, and high standards for student learning;

Aligns with the school’s mission and responds to the needs of the school’s target population, and

Based on the narrative, reviewers questioned whether the applicant clearly understands current FL standards. Numerous references were made to outdated information. Is the applicant clear about the current FL standards?

Concern

22

The proposed time blocks, especially for elementary literacy, were insufficient relative to FL requirements. Instructional time is limited in the elementary and middle grades. Offering one hour blocks twice per week for core subjects like reading (ELA) and mathematics will not meet Florida standards for instructional minutes.

Partnering with USF, ASU, multiple foreign languages, full arts and CTE programming seems unrealistic as a startup that is also growing in various grade levels. 



Concern

24

Application frequently discusses the “Florida Standards”.  It erroneously references the Common Core State Standards as a basis for Florida’s standards and neglects to mention the the Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking (B.E.S.T.) Standards which are the current required standards for ELA and Mathematics. 

Not enough detail about the programming for ELLs & students with IEPs.

No mention of how they will work with high schoolers who want to participate in sports programs





4. Curriculum Plan 

The Curriculum Plan section should explain not only what the school will teach but also how and why. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(6)(a)2, §1002.33(6)(a)4, §1002.33(7)(a)2, §1002.33(7)(a)4)

Concern

25-44

The applicant lacked specifics about its comprehensive support services.



The applicant did not explain how it would integrate use of six different curriculum providers.



The curriculum plan references the wrong state standards.

Instruction time does not meet state required minutes for reading.

Most of the applications focuses on high school curriculum and very little information addresses the student population in grades 4-8  Grades 4-8. In addition there is a significant lack of focus on instructional methodology to be used for very young students who donot have basic reading skills, and how they could potentially be successful within the virtual environment. 





Concern

25

The reading lists provided contain books banned by the State of Florida.

The application discusses facilities space; this is a virtual application.



Mention of instructional strategies such as literature circles and PBL as only available for at or above grade level students. The application labels these as advanced reading strategies- they are not, therefore it doesn’t make sense that below grade level readers would be excluded from instructional strategies. No clear set of instructional strategies for below level students, sans tutoring, is provided. 



Concern

26-33

MTSS is mentioned in one sentence with no additional context for how it fits into the overall curriculum plan or organizational design. MTSS is discussed later in the application, but there seems to be inconsistencies or a lack of understanding that it should be built into the fabric of the instructional model at the school. 



Concern

44

In the middle school requirements, there is a mention of students passing the Biology 1 EOC. Applicants do not share the course sequence that leads to Bio 1. Raising questions as to whether middle school students will take comprehensive science courses or a subject matter sequence.  The applicants do not provide enough specificity to make a determination.

1008.25 is not addressed in the application. There is not a specific discussion regarding primary grades reading, the application mostly discusses general guidelines that apply to all grade levels. The applicant fails to provide a clear and detailed plan to address the Florida reading requirements for grades K-3.

The application is missing a discussion regarding courses in science and humanities. What courses will be offered to students?





5. Student Performance, Assessment and Evaluation

The Student Performance, Assessment and Evaluation section should define what students attending the school should know and be able to do and reflect how the academic progress of individual students, cohorts over time, and the school as a whole will be measured. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(6)(a)3, §1002.33(7)(a)3, §1002.33(7)(a)4, §1002.33(7)(a)5)

Some of the goals included are not clear and detailed making them difficult to measure.  For example, a five year proficiency goal of 80% with limited discussion of how this scale of improvement will be achieved other than naming broad strategies such as remediation or acceleration without citing staff that will provide the remediation, when it will occur, at what frequency, evidence of success of the proposed strategy with students that are similarly situated, etc.

 

The applicant states that they will follow the Pinellas County student progression plan requirements.  The application doesn’t meet the standards of the Pinellas County SPG. The application lacks details regarding MTSS and student interventions, grade 3 promotion, CAPE certification options, and middle school PE and health requirements.





Concern

The section for English Language Learners is missing details about student placement and progress monitoring.  The application makes no mention of WIDA testing. How will this occur? 



The assessment schedule in Attachment C is only the state assessment schedule. No additional information was provided for the numerous other assessments that were mentioned throughout the applicationWhere is the schedule for all of the assessments mentioned in the application? 



Concern

53

Numerous assessments are indicated throughout the application narrative without explanation. It is not explained what the assessments are, if they are vendor-based, or whether they are reliable and predictive indicators Are the assessment tools mentioned vendor-based? Which vendors? Are these tools reliable and predictive indicators of student performance on Florida’s standards state assessments? .



Concern

51

Effective MTSS guidance should include decision rules regarding when interventions should be escalated (e.g., Pinellas SPG mentions students failing a class as a trigger) and monitoring of implementation fidelity. Neither of these are mentioned in the plan.

The goal of an Early Warning Systems ( EWS ) is to name or detect when things go wrong using thresholds (e.g. # of absences) which aren’t mentioned nor is specific timing provided as to when students will be identified.

The application states statement that “Pinellas County will oversee the administration of PM3 with support from their team.”  It is unclear what this means, and is not the way the state assessment system typically works, therefore we would have expected more explanation. In addition, if they are marketing their school to students statewide as is described in the application, there is no explanation of what the implications are for students who reside outside of Pinellas county. Therefore it is unable to determine if the school will What is the mean? More details are needed detailing how the school will ensure that it will be compliant with state assessment protocols for all assessments.

There is no mention of student social emotional health in the application at all.





6. Exceptional Students 

The Exceptional Students section should demonstrate an understanding of the requirements of the school to serve all students and provide a concrete plan for meeting the broad spectrum of educational needs and providing all students with a quality education. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(16)(a)3).

Reviewers raised significant concerns that the application names that they will follow all of the guidance from Pinellas County for MTSS and Child Find. However, there was no explanation of HOW the  will the applicant will implement these policies and procedures without similar structures in place for staffing, support, etc.?  This was not addressed with sufficient specificity.



In making the student population projection of 18% based on FDOE website data, the applicants did not account for variations in the virtual learning environments, that number is based on all public schools.

FLDOE website indicates 16% state-wide and 12% for virtual.  Assumption is incorrect. 



Concern

57

18% is approximately 54 students. The applicants indicate that the initial staffing is one ESE teacher and 1 gifted teacher. These ratios do  not align to standards.  The application is not clear as to how the staffing will work.  

The application is unclear and woefully lacking as to how the proposed school will serve students with disabilities effectively. No budget for ancillary services (e.g. speech) is provided.  The applicants also fail to provide detail regarding the provision of OT and PT services. 



Concern

LSS position is of concern because they have so many responsibilities with MTSS and students identified with disabilities. They need extensive training in interventions, which are not aligned with the qualifications listed.





7. English Language Learners

The English Language Learners section should demonstrate an understanding of the requirements of the school to serve English Language Learner students and provide a concrete plan for meeting the broad spectrum of educational needs and providing all students with a quality education.

Commits to at least three full-time TESOL/TESL-certified ELL

teachers, with professional development and endorsement support.



Concern

71-74

The applicant did not include an ELL enrollment projection. The 3-person ELL staff suggests a moderate ELL population, but the application doesn't provide numbers or percentages of expected ELL enrollment. A realistic projection (e.g., “we anticipate 8–12% of students will need ELL services”) is needed to match staffing to need. The reviewer could not identify the budget for the 3 ELL teachers.  If they are in basic instruction, ratios for basic instruction after pulling out ELL are very high.   In addition, the three positions are not found in the budget presented by the applicant.

Applicant sStates students will have full access to programming, but do not indicate how.



The mainstream and sheltered models are mentioned, but details are thin. Best practice requires specifying instructional methods such as SDAIE, explicitly teaching language development, co-planning time with ESOL teachers, and access to sheltered-content courses

While communication in multiple languages and workshops are promised, the plan lacks specifics on frequency or structure (e.g., monthly family nights, parent advisory committees, translated materials for testing and placement letters).

It’s unclear how screeners will be administered online within the 20-day window, or how sheltered instruction and WIDA-accessible assessments will be implemented virtually.





8. School Culture and Discipline

The School Climate and Discipline section should describe the learning environment of the school and provide evidence that the school will ensure a safe environment conducive to learning. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(7)(a)7, §1002.33(7)(a)11)



Evaluation Criteria:

Part II. Organizational Plan

The Organizational Plan should provide an understanding of how the school will be governed and managed. It should present a clear picture of the school’s governance and management priorities, what responsibilities various groups and people will have, and how those groups will relate to one another.



10. Governance 

The Governance section should describe how the policy-making and oversight function of the school will be structured and operate. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(7)(a)15, §1002.33(9))



Evaluation Criteria:

It was also impossible to determine whose signature was on the governance disclosure forms provided on behalf of the Chairperson.  Overall, the delineation between the Governing Board and the school management company is unclear and worrisome with regards to managing conflicts of interest as the inevitably arise.

The narrative explains the skill sets required in a governing board, however the current governing board does not have the skill sets the narrative identified as required. 

The lack of local representation from Florida also raises concerns in terms of how the governing board is going to stay connected with the school community. 

No indication of how the school plans to meet sunshine requirements with governing board members who are all out of state, and no indication that they understand the meeting requirements when meeting electronically. Also, no indication was provided in the narrative that the applicant understands the need to have a physical meeting location for those who are unable to attend virtually. In addition, in indication the applicant understands the need to have the principal and a individual who has been appointed to facilitate communication is required to be physically present at each meeting. 

There is no evidence of understanding open meeting laws especially as it relates to TRIM requirements for budget.

Application indicates tax exempt status will be applied for. That should be in place.The applicant’s narrative is inconsistent about the current corporate status of the organization.  They indicate that they “will file for corporation,” and that “they are in the process of incorporating” and that the school “has applied for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status with the IRS.”  These three statements are inconsistent and cannot all be true simultaneously.

Concern

121-22, Budget printout 15

With the involvement of the CEO and only 0.5 FTE of an Exec Dir (and later a Principal), this prompts questions of how will staffing, and overall financing, be separate and distinct from the commercial school?

Concern

81, Budget printout 15

During planning and start up, the staffing plan identifies a what is the interplay between the CEO of the Board, and the a 0.5 Exec Dir (or perhaps they are the same position and the applicant is using the terms interchangeably, but this raises concerns about the validity and clarity of the plan).  There is no explanation of how these roles

Clearly a lot of thought went into the staffing plan for leadership and administration, however the same depth is not apparent in creating the staffing structure for teachers and support staff.  

It is difficult to determine what differentiated levels of support will be provided for new and struggling teachers. The application states that “support” will be provided and experienced teachers will provide assistance. The narrative does not explain What other mechanisms that would will be in place to support and train teachers who are new to teaching and/or teaching in the virtual environment?.

The application doesn’t have enrollment projections by grade level or quantified goals.



The applicant includes a statement that the school would “offer scholarships or financial aid options to ensure access regardless of financial constraints” which raises concerns about the applicants understand that this would be a public school, and that they are not

Year 1 budget is confusing as the narrative discusses hiring several administration staff that are not budgeted.

Concern

Budget Printout 1

The percentage of full enrollment assumption is unrealistic, given course completion rates trend lower for virtual schools.

Concern

Budget printout 32,36

The applicant proposes an inadequate budget for Accounting Fees and Internet.



Year 1 budget is $400,000 and indicates it is all for recruiting, not presented as such in the spreadsheets.

Virtual schools are funded based on course completion.  Budget assumes 100% funding of all students.  Virtual % percent completion is around 85%, when this is properly applied to the budget, funding is in a deficit.

Application indicates funding for teachers is $445K and they intend to hire 13 teachers.  Their pay would be $34,000.  State minimum for teachers is $47,500 before benefits. 

In looking at the budget template that was used, the number of teachers is significantly less than the narrative indicates as well.  Page 96 of the application indicates 13 teachers including IEP, ELL, SLP and electives) during year one.  However, the budget includes only During year one, they would need 13 teachers to meet the description in the narrative, but only 9.8 FTE teachers.

Applicant indicates understanding of the state FEFP funding formula yet they define the acronym as Foundation for Excellence in Education.  FEFP has been defined in Florida statute since 1973 as Florida Education Finance Program.

Budget relies on staff taking voluntary leave if enrollment does not materialize.  Reality is they would be released and eligible for unemployment benefits which are not adequately budgeted.

Budget documents indicate that at 50% enrollment, they would need an additional loan which they do not have a commitment for.

Narrative indicates they will have a facility, it is not budgeted.

Narrative indicates they will use multiple platforms to educate students, the total funding is approx.. $1,250 per student including laptop which is inadequate.  



Concern

118

Narrative indicates that they will use an external firm for payroll, day to day financial operations. Monthly financial statements and annual audit.  Budget of $15,000 is significantly underfunded for these tasks.

Concern

116, Attachment T

The applicant mentions relying on a line of credit from Legacy School Inc. of $560,000. The loan will be paid back in two payments in years 4 & 5. What happens if the school doesn’t meet enrollment targets? 

The terms outlined in the financial letter of intent do not match the 5 year budget. The letter states that the principal will be repaid in equal installments in years 3, 4 & 5 while the budget only accounts for repayment in years 4 & 5.



The applicant assumes successful completion of advanced placement, dual enrollment additional FTE, the amount they are anticipating in revenue from these programs is more than the than the net revenue presented in the budget each year, so without those funds their budget will be in the negative, and that is not a guaranteed source of income, so it can not be guaranteed. If just these funds were not realized, the budget would not work.

Based on the descriptions used throughout the narrative, the number of staff members presented in the budget does not align with the narrative.  For example, based on 1 ESE teacher for every 15-20 students as indicated in section 6, the school would need to hire 0.5 – 0.7 FTE for the first year of operation, but their budget document only included 0.4 FTE. This is true each year of operation, by year five the discrepancy is that the calculations indicate 3.4 – 4.5 teachers are needed, but they only budgeted for 2.8.   These types fof comparisons were also true for the counselor, for which a 0.8FTE would be required based on 1 cousnelor for every 250 students as indicated in the narrative, but they have only budgeted a 0.2 FTE counselor.  Learning Support Specialists are even more pronounced.  Where they have indicated they would have on parapro foe every 30-40 students, this would require about 5-6.6 FTE during year one, but the only have one position in the budget. 

Section 7 says they will hire at least 3 ELL teachers. In the budget the only have 0.4 during year one, and 2.8 year 3 so they never have a full 3 staff members like they say they will in the narrative.

Narrative indicates that 90 students will qualify for free equipment year 1, they have put exactly 90 computers in the budget.  Later in the narrative they talk about having a reserve of computers for when machines break, this is not accounted for in the budget. 

No staff computers are included. 



No IT service provider, while they do have one person on staff, given the virtual nature and supporting so many machines remotely, this seems unrealistic.



No contracted ESE services, how will they meet the needs of students who may require additional services (i.e. OT, PT)



Year 3 is operating at a loss. 



Years 1, 2 and 4 are very close. Any small deviation in assumptions could make the budget negative.





21 (17). Financial Management and Oversight

The Financial Management and Oversight section should describe how the school’s finances will be managed and who will be responsible for the protection of student and financial records. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(6)(a)5, §1002.33(7)(a)9, §1002.33(7)(a)11)
