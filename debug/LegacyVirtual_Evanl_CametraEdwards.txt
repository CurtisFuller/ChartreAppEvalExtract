Virtual Charter Application 
Review Team Feedback Notes







The Florida Charter Institute (FCI) utilizes this form to solicit feedback from the Review Team for a charter application. At the conclusion of our work to review the charter application we will ask that you submit this form to the FCI to document your notes and feedback on the application. 



It is important to remember that the FCI uses the review team to decide whether or not to recommend a charter application for approval. No individual member of the review team decides. The work we do is often subject to public record laws. It is possible that we may receive a public record request and need to provide copies of the work product used to lead to our final recommendation. Therefore remember that any notes you write on this form should be professional and able to be shared with the public.



Florida Charter School Application Evaluation Instrument



Each section presents criteria for a response that meets the standard, and these criteria should guide your consideration of each section. This form is developed so that you can mark each comment with one of the following: Question, Strength, Concern, or Follow Up. The table also allows you to indicate where in the section you are referring to, along with comments to explain your rationale. 



Capacity Interview: 



All applicants whose application meets the basic requirements during an initial interview will be invited to present their plan and demonstrate the team’s capacity to open and maintain a high-quality charter school and answer questions about their proposal. Before the interview, the review team will meet to discuss their independent review and compile a list of potential questions the team had while reviewing the application. Not all review team members will always participate in the interview. 



Following the capacity interview, those participating will be asked to update their notes and submit this form to the FCI.

Executive Summary



While the executive summary is not a scored section of the application, we encourage applicants to use the opportunity to develop their “elevator pitch”. The FCI hopes that the Executive Summary will paint a clear picture of the need the proposed school will fill, and how the unique program that the school will offer will meet that need. 





Part I – Educational Plan



The education plan should define what students will achieve, how they will achieve it, and how the school will evaluate performance. It should provide a clear picture of what a student who attends the school will experience in terms of educational climate, structure, assessment, and outcomes.





1. Mission, Guiding Principles and Purpose

The Mission, Guiding Principles and Purpose section should indicate what the school intends to do, for whom and to what degree. [Statutory Reference §1002.33(2)] 



A response that meets the standard will present: 



A clear and compelling mission and vision statement that defines the guiding principles and values of the school.

Adequate references to evidence that the application fulfills the statutory guiding principles and purposes for charter schools. (Note: the substance of each addressed principle and purpose will be evaluated within appropriate application sections.)

The applicant provides a well-defined picture of the anticipated student body and names specifically: English Language Learners, students from military families, homeschooled students, gifted students, and those facing academic or social-emotional challenges.

The mention of diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds does align with the local Pinellas County demographics and the schools stated mission of inclusivity. 

The projected enrollment table and rationale for growth seem manageable, with some caveats listed below.

The enrollment fluctuations need more explanation. For example, grade 7 goes from 25 to 50 to 25 to 50. Why are some grades doubling and then halving? Explain the inconsistency.

The enrollment projects begin with upper elementary through high school in year 1; why start with 4th grade? 





3. Educational Program Design

The Educational Program Design section should describe the educational foundation of the school and the teaching and learning strategies that will be employed. [Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(7)(a)2.]



A response that meets the standard will present an educational program design that:



An educational program design that:

Is clear and coherent; 

Is based on effective, experience or research-based educational practices and teaching methods, and high standards for student learning;

Aligns with the school’s mission and responds to the needs of the school’s target population, and 

Is likely lead to improved student performance for the school’s target population.

• A clear explanation of how the school will comply with statutory requirements in section 1002.45(3)(d), F.S.



1002:45(3)(d): Provide each full-time student enrolled in the virtual instruction program who qualifies for free or reduced-price school lunches under the National School Lunch Act, or who is on the direct certification list, and who does not have a computer or Internet access in his or her home with:

The application is missing a discussion regarding courses in science and humanities. What courses will be offered to students? 





5. Student Performance, Assessment and Evaluation

The Student Performance, Assessment and Evaluation section should define what students attending the school should know and be able to do and reflect how the academic progress of individual students, cohorts over time, and the school as a whole will be measured. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(6)(a)3, §1002.33(7)(a)3, §1002.33(7)(a)4, §1002.33(7)(a)5)

Concern

Reference

The 3-person ELL staff suggests a moderate ELL population, but the application doesn't provide numbers or percentages of expected ELL enrollment. A realistic projection (e.g., “we anticipate 8–12% of students will need ELL services”) is needed to match staffing to need.



The mainstream and sheltered models are mentioned, but details are thin. Best practice requires specifying instructional methods such as SDAIE, explicitly teaching language development, co-planning time with ESOL teachers, and access to sheltered-content courses



While communication in multiple languages and workshops are promised, the plan lacks specifics on frequency or structure (e.g., monthly family nights, parent advisory committees, translated materials for testing and placement letters).



It’s unclear how screeners will be administered online within the 20-day window, or how sheltered instruction and WIDA-accessible assessments will be implemented virtually.



8. School Culture and Discipline

The School Climate and Discipline section should describe the learning environment of the school and provide evidence that the school will ensure a safe environment conducive to learning. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(7)(a)7, §1002.33(7)(a)11)



Evaluation Criteria:

Part II. Organizational Plan

The Organizational Plan should provide an understanding of how the school will be governed and managed. It should present a clear picture of the school’s governance and management priorities, what responsibilities various groups and people will have, and how those groups will relate to one another.



10. Governance 

The Governance section should describe how the policy-making and oversight function of the school will be structured and operate. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(7)(a)15, §1002.33(9))



Evaluation Criteria:

The Replications section should identify the school to be replicated and provide evidence that the model has been successful in raising student achievement, while also describing the capacity of the organization to operate an additional school. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(6))



Evaluation Criteria:

A response that meets the standard will present an action plan that:



Evidence that school or model to be replicated demonstrates academic, organizational, and financial success. 

A clear, compelling vision for what is being replicated in terms of essential components of the educational program.

A convincing rationale for how the school or model to be replicated will successfully serve the proposed target student population.

A strong justification for changing key components of the original school or model in the proposed school. Such justification should include why the changes will better suit the targeted student population and whether the model is still similar enough to the existing model that comparable successful outcomes are likely.

Evidence that the applicant group has a sound plan for developing the capacity to replicate an existing school including adequate financial and human resources.

If applicable, evidence of successful past replications or lessons learned from unsuccessful attempts at replication that will increase the probability that this replication will be successful.

Addendum B: Education Service Providers

 

The ESP section should provide a rationale for contracting with the ESP, evidence of ESP success in operating high-quality charter schools, the capacity of the ESP to successfully operate this school, and evidence that the governing board and ESP are able to operate free from conflicts of interest. (Statutory Reference(s): §1002.33(6)(a))



Evaluation Criteria:

A response that meets the standard will present an action plan that:



A clear explanation of the reasons for contracting with an education service provider and how and why the ESP was selected and a description of the due diligence employed to assess the capacity of the ESP.

Sufficient evidence of the ESP’s previous academic, organizational, and financial success and capacity for future success that make it more likely than not that it will be successful with the proposed school. 

Evidence of the ESP’s organizational capacity to manage an additional school or schools as determined by its growth plan.

A comprehensive list (Form IEPC-MIA) of all schools affiliated with the ESP and ensuing performance data used to support the selection of the ESP (past and current).

Evidence of success working with similar populations to the target population. If there are deficiencies or lack of experience working with the target populations, then reviewers will look for a sufficient explanation of programmatic adjustments that will be made to ensure success with any new school(s).

A description and explanation, as necessary, of how the governing board and ESP will operate free from statutory conflicts of interest.

A clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities and decision-making authority of the school’s governing board and the ESP, structured to ensure a clearly defined arm’s-length, performance-based relationship that is free from conflicts of interest. This includes evidence that the school’s governing board has a clear plan for holding the ESP accountable for negotiated performance.

A clear delineation of the term of the management agreement, the conditions, grounds and procedures by which the agreement may be renewed and terminated, and a plan for continued operation of the school in the event of termination.

A draft of the proposed contract with all key terms included.
