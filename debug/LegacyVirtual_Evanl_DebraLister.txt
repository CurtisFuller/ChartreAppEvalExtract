Virtual Charter Application 
Review Team Feedback Notes







The Florida Charter Institute (FCI) utilizes this form to solicit feedback from the Review Team for a charter application. At the conclusion of our work to review the charter application we will ask that you submit this form to the FCI to document your notes and feedback on the application. 



It is important to remember that the FCI uses the review team to decide whether or not to recommend a charter application for approval. No individual member of the review team decides. The work we do is often subject to public record laws. It is possible that we may receive a public record request and need to provide copies of the work product used to lead to our final recommendation. Therefore remember that any notes you write on this form should be professional and able to be shared with the public.



Florida Charter School Application Evaluation Instrument



Each section presents criteria for a response that meets the standard, and these criteria should guide your consideration of each section. This form is developed so that you can mark each comment with one of the following: Question, Strength, Concern, or Follow Up. The table also allows you to indicate where in the section you are referring to, along with comments to explain your rationale. 



Capacity Interview: 



All applicants whose application meets the basic requirements during an initial interview will be invited to present their plan and demonstrate the team’s capacity to open and maintain a high-quality charter school and answer questions about their proposal. Before the interview, the review team will meet to discuss their independent review and compile a list of potential questions the team had while reviewing the application. Not all review team members will always participate in the interview. 



Following the capacity interview, those participating will be asked to update their notes and submit this form to the FCI.

At our school, reading is a primary focus of the 

curriculum, with a robust and research-based 

approach that supports students across all reading levels. Our curriculum is aligned with Florida’s state 

standards, including the Language Arts Florida 

Standards (LAFS) and the B.E.S.T. Standards, 

ensuring that every student is provided with the 

necessary tools to succeed in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language skills. 

For students reading at or above grade level, we offer advanced reading strategies such as literature circles, Socratic seminars, and project-based learning, 

fostering critical thinking and complex literary analysis. Our program emphasizes the importance of academic rigor, promoting higher-order literacy skills essential for success in middle school, high school, and beyond. 

For students reading below grade level, our curriculum integrates foundational phonics instruction, focusing on decoding and encoding as primary strategies for word reading. We use evidence-based structured literacy programs that build phonemic awareness, fluency, and comprehension. These strategies are aligned with the Comprehensive Research-Based Reading Plan 

(CRRP), which is state-adopted and designed to meet the needs of struggling readers. 

In line with the school’s commitment to differentiated instruction, we use strategies like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to cater to diverse learning styles. 

Strength

Page 37

This includes small-group instruction, individualized 

interventions, and formative assessments that ensure all students are progressing at their own pace. For students with significant reading deficiencies, we implement 

intensive reading interventions as early as possible, following the RtI/MTSS framework for targeted support. 

Additionally, writing is integrated across all subjects, ensuring that students are not only reading critically but also expressing their understanding through written responses, journal entries, and essays. Grammar, usage, and mechanics (GUM) are taught explicitly to support students in mastering the conventions of standard 

English, preparing them for future assessments and success in college and career. 

Math 

For students performing at or above grade level, the curriculum is designed to challenge them and expand their problem-solving and reasoning skills. These 

students will engage with advanced topics such as 

algebra, geometry, calculus, and data analysis, all within the framework of the MAFS. 

For students performing below grade level, the curriculum focuses on building foundational math skills. The goal is to ensure mastery of basic operations and concepts, such as 

addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, before moving on to more complex material.

students, parents, and teachers to refine programs 

and ensure satisfaction. 

Desired Results: 

Within five years, Legacy Charter School aims to: 

1. Achieve at least 80% proficiency in ELA and Mathematics across all grades. 

2. Reduce the percentage of students scoring at 

Level 1 to below 10% in both subjects. 3. Exceed 

district averages in learning gains, particularly for 

historically underserved student groups. 4.

To support this goal, the school will provide high-quality world language instruction and opportunities for students to participate in cultural exchange programs, preparing them to navigate diverse cultural and professional environments confidently. 

Student Engagement and Leadership Development Legacy Charter School seeks to inspire students to become active, engaged leaders in their communities. By providing diverse extracurricular activities and leadership 

development programs, the school aims for 100% of students to participate in at least one extracurricular or leadership opportunity annually. Participation rates and student feedback will be used to evaluate success. Through mentoring, leadership workshops, and student-led 

initiatives, Legacy Charter School ensures students cultivate skills in collaboration, communication, and 

problem-solving. 

In our virtual setting, mandatory assessments will be conducted using a structured and secure approach to ensure compliance with state and district requirements while maintaining accessibility for all students.

Legacy School Inc., a U.S.-based company, plans to provide financial assistance to Legacy Virtual School 

through a loan of $400,000 at an annual interest rate of 8% over a six-year term, contingent upon the 

approval of the application. Interest payments will begin in the year following the loan disbursement, with 

the principal to be repaid in equal installments during the 3rd, 4th, and 5th years of the school’s 

operation. 

In addition, Legacy School Inc. is prepared to offer an additional $160,000 credit line at an annual interest 

rate of 8%, with a five-year term starting from the first year post-approval. The principal for this credit 

line will also be repaid in equal installments over the 3rd, 4th, and 5th years of the school’s operation. 

Revenue Assumptions: 

Foundation Funding; The budget relies on calculations from the Foundation for Excellence in Education 

(FEFP) as a revenue source. Key elements include Base FEFP Funding,

ESE Guaranteed Allocation and 

specific allocations like Supplemental Academic Instruction, Safe Schools and Discretionary Local Effort. 

The projections indicate an increase in FEFP revenue as enrollment grows annually. 

Percentage Reserve: Allocating 3% of the total budget annually to reserves ensures that the contingency fund 

keeps pace with the school's expansion and operational costs. This strategy allows for financial flexibility and 

preparedness in case of revenue fluctuations. 

At 75% of Revenue Projections 

The school would implement cost-cutting measures across non-essential services and delay any expansion 

plans to prioritize core operations. 

The reserve fund would cover immediate shortfalls, allowing time to adjust operational costs and seek 

additional funding sources. 

At 50% of Revenue Projections 

The school would rely heavily on its reserve fund to maintain essential operations. 

Significant adjustments would be necessary, including reductions in discretionary spending, contract 

renegotiations, and potential staffing adjustments. 

The school could leverage an additional credit line from Legacy School Inc., which has already committed 

$400,000 to support the preparatory year and $160,000 to the 1st year. 

If necessary, the school would explore alternative funding sources to bridge the financial gap.

Evaluation Criteria:

A response that meets the standard will present:



A clear description of how the school’s finances will be managed, including who (or what contracted entity) will manage the finances. Such plan should contain strong internal controls to ensure appropriate fiscal management and ability to comply with all financial reporting requirements.
