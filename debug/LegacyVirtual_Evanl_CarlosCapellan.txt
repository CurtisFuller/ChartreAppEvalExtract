Virtual Charter Application 
Review Team Feedback Notes







The Florida Charter Institute (FCI) utilizes this form to solicit feedback from the Review Team for a charter application. At the conclusion of our work to review the charter application we will ask that you submit this form to the FCI to document your notes and feedback on the application. 



It is important to remember that the FCI uses the review team to decide whether or not to recommend a charter application for approval. No individual member of the review team decides. The work we do is often subject to public record laws. It is possible that we may receive a public record request and need to provide copies of the work product used to lead to our final recommendation. Therefore remember that any notes you write on this form should be professional and able to be shared with the public.



Florida Charter School Application Evaluation Instrument



Each section presents criteria for a response that meets the standard, and these criteria should guide your consideration of each section. This form is developed so that you can mark each comment with one of the following: Question, Strength, Concern, or Follow Up. The table also allows you to indicate where in the section you are referring to, along with comments to explain your rationale. 



Capacity Interview: 



All applicants whose application meets the basic requirements during an initial interview will be invited to present their plan and demonstrate the team’s capacity to open and maintain a high-quality charter school and answer questions about their proposal. Before the interview, the review team will meet to discuss their independent review and compile a list of potential questions the team had while reviewing the application. Not all review team members will always participate in the interview. 



Following the capacity interview, those participating will be asked to update their notes and submit this form to the FCI.

Executive Summary



While the executive summary is not a scored section of the application, we encourage applicants to use the opportunity to develop their “elevator pitch”. The FCI hopes that the Executive Summary will paint a clear picture of the need the proposed school will fill, and how the unique program that the school will offer will meet that need. 





Part I – Educational Plan



The education plan should define what students will achieve, how they will achieve it, and how the school will evaluate performance. It should provide a clear picture of what a student who attends the school will experience in terms of educational climate, structure, assessment, and outcomes.
